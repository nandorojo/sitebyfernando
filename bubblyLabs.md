## About Us
### The origin
By the time I was three, I had ruined the first computer I ever used. 

Now, I'm not talking physical damage here. It was more of a, "I wonder how this big thing works" situation gone wrong.

I can now see why my parents weren't happy. 

But I was just getting started.

It wasn't until I turned eight that I started to channel my curiosity in a less destructive way. I started my first website, named KuleTV, and the fun began.

KuleTV offered free video tutorials for small computer hacks. It attracted 100,000+ hits over time. 

The videos I made were pretty embarassing.
