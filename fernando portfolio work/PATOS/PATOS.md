# Creating the world's coolest sneaker brand

I've spent the past few years building and growing PATOS, a fashion brand that sells handcrafted Latin American footwear.

Today, it's normal to come across my sneakers on the shelves at J.Crew or in an NBC feature. But it wasn't long ago that I was struggling to reach my first 5 pairs of shoes sold.

So, how'd we get here?

## Who makes the shoes we wear?

It wasn't until I met a man named Rafael that I started to question why I have no idea who makes the shoes I wear.

Rafael is an Argentian artisan who makes shoes by hand. Every weekend, he hops in his red Toyota and drives an hour into Buenos Aires to sell his shoes at a local artisan fair.

The shoes are bright and eye-catching, with authentic Latin American textiles sourced from local suppliers covering them.

And while he's been making shoes by hand for 20 years, Rafael's only true customer base is the handful of locals and tourists who happen to walk by his shoe stand as they venture through the flea market.

## "Wait, what?"

While visiting my grandparents in Buenos Aires, I happened to come across Rafael's stand. And as I watched tourists crowd around in awe of his shoes, I had nothing but questions. 

I mean, here was this guy who had an amazing skill, an inspiring story, and a beautiful product. 

Why don't I see his shoes back home? Wouldn't people love to wear these knowing they're supporting Rafael? **And why do I have no idea who makes the shoes I normally wear?**

So I asked, and we talked for hours.

He started making shoes when he was 16 when he found out he had a son on the way. He spent decades becoming an expert at making shoes, only to find that he had no access to the international market that would love them.

## "How much does this suitcase fit?"

So without much thought, I did what anyone would have done in that scenario. I asked Rafael if he would sell me fifty pairs of shoes to take home to the United States.

Two weeks later, I picked up the shoes from Rafael, stuffed them into my suitcase, and hopped on a plane back to Penn.

There began my bizarre, life-changing journey to start a global footwear brand called **PATOS**.

(This was underratedly one of the most pivotal moments of my life.)

## "The world's coolest sneaker brand"

In the three years since meeting Rafael, I've hired over 15 artisans across poor villages in Peru and Argentina to handcraft shoes and backpacks under safe working conditions with fair pay.

We've sold thousands of shoes across 15 countries, partnered with J.Crew, raised over $60,000 on Kickstarter. 

And whenever you buy a pair of PATOS, you get a cool postcard that tells you who made your PATOS.

Rafael continues still has his own PATOS collection – the Yoga Flats – to this day.
