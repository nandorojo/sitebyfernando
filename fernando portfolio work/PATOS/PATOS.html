<h1 id="toc_0">Creating the world&#39;s coolest sneaker brand</h1>

<p><img src="/Users/Fernando/Downloads/Fernando CEO copy.jpeg" alt="Fernando Rojo, Penn grad, is the Founder and CEO at PATOS Shoes."></p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent the past few years building and growing PATOS, a fashion brand that sells handcrafted Latin American footwear.</p>

<p>Today, it&#39;s normal to come across my sneakers on the shelves at J.Crew or in an NBC feature. But it wasn&#39;t long ago that I was struggling to reach my first 5 pairs of shoes sold.</p>

<p>So, how&#39;d we get here?</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Who makes the shoes we wear?</h2>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until I met a man named Rafael that I started to question why I have no idea who makes the shoes I wear.</p>

<p>Rafael is an Argentian artisan who makes shoes by hand. Every weekend, he hops in his red Toyota and drives an hour into Buenos Aires to sell his shoes at a local artisan fair.</p>

<p>The shoes are bright and eye-catching, with authentic Latin American textiles sourced from local suppliers covering them.</p>

<p>And while he&#39;s been making shoes by hand for 20 years, Rafael&#39;s only true customer base is the handful of locals and tourists who happen to walk by his shoe stand as they venture through the flea market.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">&quot;Wait, what?&quot;</h2>

<p>While visiting my grandparents in Buenos Aires, I happened to come across Rafael&#39;s stand. And as I watched tourists crowd around in awe of his shoes, I had nothing but questions. </p>

<p>I mean, here was this guy who had an amazing skill, an inspiring story, and a beautiful product. </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t I see his shoes back home? Wouldn&#39;t people love to wear these knowing they&#39;re supporting Rafael? <strong>And why do I have no idea who makes the shoes I normally wear?</strong></p>

<p>So I asked, and we talked for hours.</p>

<p>He started making shoes when he was 16 when he found out he had a son on the way. He spent decades becoming an expert at making shoes, only to find that he had no access to the international market that would love them.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">&quot;How much does this suitcase fit?&quot;</h2>

<p>So without much thought, I did what anyone would have done in that scenario. I asked Rafael if he would sell me fifty pairs of shoes to take home to the United States.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, I picked up the shoes from Rafael, stuffed them into my suitcase, and hopped on a plane back to Penn.</p>

<p>There began my bizarre, life-changing journey to start a global footwear brand called <strong>PATOS</strong>.</p>

<p>(This was underratedly one of the most pivotal moments of my life.)</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">&quot;The world&#39;s coolest sneaker brand&quot;</h2>

<p>In the three years since meeting Rafael, I&#39;ve hired over 15 artisans across poor villages in Peru and Argentina to handcraft shoes and backpacks under safe working conditions with fair pay.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve sold thousands of shoes across 15 countries, partnered with J.Crew, raised over $60,000 on Kickstarter. </p>

<p>And whenever you buy a pair of PATOS, you get a cool postcard that tells you who made your PATOS.</p>

<p>Rafael continues still has his own PATOS collection – the Yoga Flats – to this day.</p>
