## Code Panda
Code Panda solves the age-old front-end developer's dilemma: do I use a WYSIWYG website editor or custom-code a website? 

It's is a dependency-free static website builder meant for creators who like the option to edit code **and** design with ease. This open-source web app is comprised of a WYSIWYG editor and a repository of modular HTML/CSS code blocks. 

Code Panda lets you style your design and edit copy with a Squarespace-esque editor, ultimately letting you download your well-documented HTML &amp; responsive CSS to edit it as you please.

## Pantry
You have a few ingredients in your kitchen. You only have fifteen minutes. What meal do you whip up?

Pantry lets you find awesome recipes using ingredients you already have in your pantry. Choose how much time &amp; complexity you want for your dish and get to eating.

## animateMePlz
Adding interactive animations to your website can be a pain. And doing so in a way that maintains clean CSS while working with your Javascript files adds loads of unnecessary work.

animateMePlz is a jQuery plugin that lets you instantly add animations to your website that respond to user scrolling, adding a dynamic, responsive layer of interaction to any website in seconds.

## gradientGod
Anyone from Apple to Spotify has embraced the wonderful style of gradients in their web design. But prototyping, editing and deploying CSS gradients on websites can be a bit laborious. 

gradientGod is a simple web app that lets you visually generate CSS gradients that are optimized for any browser.

## Fresh Prints Design Overhaul
I always loved Fresh Prints – both as a business model and as an actual service that I used myself. As a custom apparel business for college students, Fresh Prints needed an overhaul of their website to allow for a better online customization experience along with a modernized brand.

**First, the Fresh Prints team sent along their ideal website via wireframe images:**

## Connor Blakley

Connor needed to impress a client, and he only had a few hours. He called me and told me **he needed a pitch deck and a one-pager** within 2 hours. As one of the leading Gen-Z consultants &amp; speakers, Connor had to show up to land his speaking gig. 

And he did.

I helped Connor re-structure his copy into a more organized and compelling work that targeted towards his Fortune 500 client and did his skills justice.

*(example of sentences I changed)*

The next step was designing it to look, well, great.

### (After) What I sent back to Connor:

### Connor's Brand
Professional yet young. Risky yet trusting. As an 18-year-old consulting major companies, Connor's brand needed to embody many such dichotomies. 

#### Color scheme

In order to achieve a perception of professionalism and expertise, I used a modern pairing of traditionally trustworthy blue hues, defaulting to a lighter gray body color that was easier on the eyes and allowed the logos and headings to dominate.

#### Typography
Sofia was the ideal typeface for Connor: similar to Circular, with a less generic feel. Young and bold – in all senses of the word. 

By using bold across the board, readers understand that the entire page is important, allowing their eyes to guide along with colors. After all, it's a one-pager, not an essay, and we want people to easily digest the entire thing.
